# Telehealth Example

`getting-started-with-reactions` is a basic 1:1 chat application that features a message input field
and a list of messages that pile up on the screen as you send them. In addition to this basic
functionality, the app contains 6 built-in message reactions that you can add to the messages by
long-tapping on a message and selecting emojis from the bottom menu that slides up from the bottom
edge of the screen when triggered.
