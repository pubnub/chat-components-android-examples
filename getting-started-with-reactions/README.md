# Getting Started with Message Reactions

`getting-started-with-reactions` is a basic 1:1 chat application that features a message input field and a list of messages that pile up on the screen as you send them. In addition to this basic functionality, the app contains 6 built-in message reactions that you can add to the messages by long-tapping on them and selecting emojis from the bottom drawer that slides up from the bottom edge of the screen when triggered.
